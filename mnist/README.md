## TODO: 
* write notes to explain the meaning of different parts of program: what is happening in the model class, what does the train/test method do, what does the optimizer and learning rate scheduler do, how does the performance across CPU and GPU differ, give an actual dummy image and check the output of the model, for let's say 1000 images, where does the model fail to identify?
